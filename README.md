# Project Name
Expectiminimax-Search-and-Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Gobang

# Description
This project is an endeavor to combine Expectiminimax with Convolutional Neural Network to crack a pure strategic chess game, Gobang. We report our AI agentâ€™s performance in playing against baseline opponent, both with and without the Convolutional Neural Network component, for a range of board sizes. 

# Usage
Python 3.7
Tensorflow 1.14
