## Project Name
Expectiminimax Search and Convolutional Neural Network for Gobang

## Description
This project is an endeavor to combine Expectiminimax with Convolutional Neural Network to crack a pure strategic chess game, Gobang. We report our AI agentâ€™s performance in playing against baseline opponent, both with and without the Convolutional Neural Network component, for a range of board sizes. 

This include tree files: GoBang.py, Experiment.py, Train.py

GoBang.py -- The Interface for AI playing with human

Experiment.py -- The experiment for AI playing with baseline

Train.py -- The structure for training model. To run it, needs to download .sgf data and save in SGF directory first


## Versions:
